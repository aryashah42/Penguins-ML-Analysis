# Penguin Species Classification

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to survey different machine learning models to organize and classify a dataset of penguin species.

## Abstract
In this project, various machine learning models were surveyed to classify a dataset on different penguin species. The process included:

1. **Importing and cleaning the data.**
2. **Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover trends.**
3. **Performing feature selection to identify significant variables for predicting species.**
4. **Splitting the data into features (X) and target (y) variables, and further into training and testing sets.**
5. **Implementing three machine learning models: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Multinomial Logistic Regression.**
6. **Evaluating the performance of these models using various statistical measures.**
7. **Discussing the limitations and summarizing the findings, providing insights and potential directions for future research.**

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Place the CSV file in the `data/` directory. Ensure the file is named `palmer_penguins.csv` or update the notebook accordingly if the file name is different.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

5. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis and results.
    Once the Jupyter Notebook interface is open, click on the notebook file (e.g., `Machine Learning Classification Project.ipynb`). This will open the notebook where you can run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure
* `Machine Learning Classification Project.ipynb`: The main notebook containing data import, cleaning, analysis, model implementation, and evaluation.
* `data/`: Folder containing datasets.
  * `palmer_penguins.csv`: The CSV file containing the penguin dataset.


## Results
The notebook implements three machine learning models:
* **Support Vector Machine**
* **Random Forest**
* **Multinomial Logistic Regression**

Each model's performance is evaluated using various statistical measures. The results indicate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in classifying penguin species.

## Discussion and Conclusion
The analysis concludes with a summary of the findings, discussing the effectiveness of each model and suggesting potential improvements for future research.
